# PDFBatchPrinter
Simple Winforms app to batch print .PDF files.  

Some extra functionality exists for parsing the pdfs and using specific info to print other files. This was a worksite specific feature where we were required to print blueprints with our delivery notes when shipping to the customer. I haven't removed this functionality but it shouldn't hurt anything since it defaults to just not printing the blueprints if it can't find them - which it won't.
